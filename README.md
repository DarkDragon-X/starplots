# Star Plots

This repository has code for generating 2D and 3D plots of stars using data from the Yale Bright Star Catalog.

## Data Extraction

The **Data extraction** folder contains the initial data file and its readme. The `readfile.py` script converts it into an organized CSV file.

## 2D Star Map

The 2D star map generates an aitoff projection with RA and Declination and global coordinates.

## 3D Star Plot

The 3D plot uses the SkyCoord system to visualize stars in the catalog.
